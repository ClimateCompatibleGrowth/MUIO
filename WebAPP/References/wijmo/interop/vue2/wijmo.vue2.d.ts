    * Vue component for the {@link FlexGrid} cell templates.
    *
    * The <b>wj-flex-grid-cell-template</b> component defines a template for a certain
    * cell type in {@link FlexGrid}. The template element must contain a <b>cellType</b> attribute that
    * specifies the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.CellTemplateType}. Depending on the template's cell type,
    * the <b>wj-flex-grid-cell-template</b> element must be a child
    * of either {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGrid}
    * or {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} components.
    *
    * Column-specific cell templates must be contained in <b>wj-flex-grid-column</b>
    * components, and cells that are not column-specific (like row header or top left cells)
    * must be contained in the <b>wj-flex-grid</b> component.
    *
    * The <b>wj-flex-grid-cell-template</b> element
    * may contain an arbitrary HTML fragment with Vue interpolation expressions and
    * other components and directives.
    *
    * Bindings in HTML fragment can use scoped slot properties that store cell specific data.
    * The properties are <b>col</b>, <b>row</b>, and <b>item</b>, which refer to the {@link Column},
    * {@link Row}, and <b>Row.dataItem</b> objects pertaining to the cell.
    *
    * For cell types like <b>Group</b> and <b>CellEdit</b>, an additional <b>value</b>
    * property containing an unformatted cell value is provided.
    *
    * To reference slot properties, you can use either a new v-slot directive right on the
    * <b>wj-flex-grid-cell-template</b> element (it's available in Vue 2.6.0 or higher),
    * or an old slot-scope directive on the <b>&lt;template&gt;</b> element nested in
    * wj-flex-grid-cell-template.
    *
    * For example, here is a
    * {@link FlexGrid} control with templates for row header cells and, regular
    * and column header cells of the Country column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <!-- component.html -->
    * <wj-flex-grid :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="RowHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     {{cell.row.index}}
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="RowHeaderEdit">
    *     ...
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    *
    *   <wj-flex-grid-column header="Country" binding="country">
    *     <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="ColumnHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *       <img src="resources/globe.png" />
    *         {{cell.col.header}}
    *     </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    *     <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="Cell" v-slot="cell">
    *       <img :src="'resources/' + cell.item.country + '.png'" />
    *       {{cell.item.country}}
    *     </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    *   </wj-flex-grid-column>
    *   <wj-flex-grid-column header="Sales" binding="sales"></wj-flex-grid-column>
    * </wj-flex-grid>
    * ```
    *
    * The <b>wj-flex-grid-cell-template</b> directive supports the following attributes:
    *
    * <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    *   <dt>cellType</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     The <b>CellTemplateType</b> value defining the type of cell to which the template is applied.
    *   </dd>
    *   <dt>autoSizeRows</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     Indicates whether the cell template will increase grid's default row height
    *     to accomodate cells content. Defaults to true.
    *   </dd>
    *   <dt>cellOverflow</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     Defines the <b>style.overflow</b> property value for cells.
    *   </dd>
    *   <dt>forceFullEdit</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     For cell edit templates, indicates whether cell editing forcibly starts in full edit mode,
    *     regardless of how the editing was initiated. In full edit mode pressing cursor keys don't finish editing.
    *     Defaults to true.
    *   </dd>
    * </dl>
    *
    * The <b>cellType</b> attribute takes any of the following enumerated values:
    *
    * <b>Cell</b>
    *
    * Defines a regular (data) cell template. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component.
    * For example, this cell template shows flags in the cells of Country column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Country" binding="country">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="Cell" v-slot="cell">
    *     <img :src="'resources/' + cell.item.country + '.png'" />
    *     {{cell.item.country}}
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * If <b>Group</b> template is not provided for a hierarchical {@link FlexGrid} (that is, one with the <b>childItemsPath</b> property
    * specified), non-header cells in group rows of
    * this {@link Column} also use this template.
    *
    * <b>CellEdit</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a cell in edit mode. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component.
    * This cell type has an additional <b>value</b> scoped slot property available for binding. It contains the
    * original cell value before editing, and the updated value after editing.
    *
    * For example, here is a template that uses the Wijmo {@link InputNumber} control as an editor
    * for the "Sales" column:
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Sales" binding="sales">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="CellEdit">
    *     <wj-input-number v-model="cell.value" :step="1"></wj-input-number>
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * Note that two-way binding can also be specified using the binding's <b>sync</b> modifier:
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Sales" binding="sales">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="CellEdit">
    *     <wj-input-number value.sync="cell.value" :step="1"></wj-input-number>
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>ColumnHeader</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a column header cell. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component.
    * For example, this template adds an image to the header of the "Country" column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Country" binding="country">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="ColumnHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     <img src="resources/globe.png" />
    *     {{cell.col.header}}
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>RowHeader</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a row header cell. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGrid} component.
    * For example, this template shows row indices in the row headers:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="RowHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     {{cell.row.index + 1}}
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid>
    * ```
    *
    * Note that this template is applied to a row header cell, even if it is in a row that is
    * in edit mode. In order to provide an edit-mode version of a row header cell with alternate
    * content, define the <b>RowHeaderEdit</b> template.
    *
    * <b>RowHeaderEdit</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a row header cell in edit mode. Must be a child of the
    * {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGrid} component. For example, this template shows dots in the header
    * of rows being edited:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="RowHeaderEdit">
    *     ...
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid>
    * ```
    *
    * Use the following <b>RowHeaderEdit</b> template to add the standard edit-mode indicator to cells where the <b>RowHeader</b> template
    * applies:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="RowHeaderEdit">
    *     &#x270e;&#xfe0e;
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>TopLeft</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for the top left cell. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGrid} component.
    * For example, this template shows a down/right glyph in the top-left cell of the grid:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="TopLeft">
    *     <span class="wj-glyph-down-right"></span>
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>GroupHeader</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a group header cell in a {@link GroupRow}. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component.
    *
    * The <b>row</b> scoped slot property contains an instance of the <b>GroupRow</b> class. If the grouping comes
    * from {@link CollectionView}, the <b>item</b> scoped slot property references the {@link CollectionViewGroup} object.
    *
    * For example, this template uses a checkbox element as an expand/collapse toggle:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Country" binding="country">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="GroupHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     <input type="checkbox" v-model="cell.row.isCollapsed"/>
    *     {{cell.item.name}} ({{cell.item.items.length}} items)
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>Group</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a regular cell (not a group header) in a {@link GroupRow}. Must be a child of the
    * {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component. This cell type has an additional <b>value</b> scoped
    * slot property available for
    * binding. In cases where columns have the <b>aggregate</b> property specified, it contains the unformatted
    * aggregate value.
    *
    * For example, this template shows aggregate's value and kind for group row cells in the "Sales"
    * column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Sales" binding="sales" aggregate="Avg">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="Group" v-slot="cell">
    *     Average: {{formatNumber(cell.value, 'N0')}}
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>ColumnFooter</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a regular cell in a <b>columnFooters</b> panel. Must be a child of the
    * {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component. This cell type has an additional <b>value</b>
    * scoped slot property available for binding that contains a cell value.
    *
    * For example, this template shows aggregate's value and kind for a footer cell in the "Sales"
    * column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="Sales" binding="sales" aggregate="Avg">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="ColumnFooter" v-slot="cell">
    *     Average: {{formatNumber(cell.value, 'N0')}}
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>BottomLeft</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for the bottom left cells (at the intersection of the row header and column footer cells).
    * Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGrid} component.
    * For example, this template shows a sigma glyph in the bottom-left cell of the grid:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="BottomLeft">
    *     &#931;
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>NewCellTemplate</b>
    *
    * Defines a cell in a new row template. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.WjFlexGridColumn} component.
    * Note that the <b>cell.item</b> property is undefined for this type of a cell.
    * For example, this cell template shows a placeholder in the Date column's cell in the "new row" item:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-flex-grid-column header="'Date'" binding="'date'">
    *   <wj-flex-grid-cell-template cellType="NewCellTemplate">
    *     Enter a date here
    *   </wj-flex-grid-cell-template>
    * </wj-flex-grid-column>
    * ```

    * and column header cells of the Country column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <!-- component.html -->
    * <wj-multi-row :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="RowHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     {{cell.row.index}}
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="RowHeaderEdit">
    *     ...
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    *
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-group header="Statistics">
    *     <wj-multi-row-cell header="Country" binding="country">
    *       <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="ColumnHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *         <img src="resources/globe.png" />
    *           {{cell.col.header}}
    *       </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    *       <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="Cell" v-slot="cell">
    *         <img :src="'resources/' + cell.item.country + '.png'" />
    *         {{cell.item.country}}
    *       </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    *     </wj-multi-row-cell>
    *     <wj-multi-row-cell header="Sales" binding="sales"></wj-multi-row-cell>
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-group>
    * </wj-multi-row>
    * ```
    *
    * The <b>wj-multi-row-cell-template</b> directive supports the following attributes:
    *
    * <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    *   <dt>cellType</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     The <b>CellTemplateType</b> value defining the type of cell to which the template is applied.
    *   </dd>
    *   <dt>autoSizeRows</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     Indicates whether the cell template will increase grid's default row height
    *     to accomodate cells content. Defaults to true.
    *   </dd>
    *   <dt>cellOverflow</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     Defines the <b>style.overflow</b> property value for cells.
    *   </dd>
    *   <dt>forceFullEdit</dt>
    *   <dd>
    *     For cell edit templates, indicates whether cell editing forcibly starts in full edit mode,
    *     regardless of how the editing was initiated. In full edit mode pressing cursor keys don't finish editing.
    *     Defaults to true.
    *   </dd>
    * </dl>
    *
    * The <b>cellType</b> attribute takes any of the following enumerated values:
    *
    * <b>Cell</b>
    *
    * Defines a regular (data) cell template. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRowCell} component.
    * For example, this cell template shows flags in the cells of Country column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="Country" binding="country">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="Cell" v-slot="cell">
    *     <img :src="'resources/' + cell.item.country + '.png'" />
    *     {{cell.item.country}}
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>CellEdit</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a cell in edit mode. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRowCell} component.
    * This cell type has an additional <b>value</b> scoped slot property available for binding. It contains the
    * original cell value before editing, and the updated value after editing.
    *
    * For example, here is a template that uses the Wijmo {@link InputNumber} control as an editor
    * for the "Sales" column:
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="Sales" binding="sales">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="CellEdit">
    *     <wj-input-number v-model="cell.value" :step="1"></wj-input-number>
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
    *
    * Note that two-way binding can also be specified using the binding's <b>sync</b> modifier:
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="Sales" binding="sales">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="CellEdit">
    *     <wj-input-number value.sync="cell.value" :step="1"></wj-input-number>
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>ColumnHeader</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a column header cell. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRowCell} component.
    * For example, this template adds an image to the header of the "Country" column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="Country" binding="country">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="ColumnHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     <img src="resources/globe.png" />
    *     {{cell.col.header}}
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>RowHeader</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a row header cell. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRow} component.
    * For example, this template shows row indices in the row headers:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="RowHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     {{cell.row.index / cell.row.grid.rowsPerItem + 1}}
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row>
    * ```
    *
    * Note that this template is applied to a row header cell, even if it is in a row that is
    * in edit mode. In order to provide an edit-mode version of a row header cell with alternate
    * content, define the <b>RowHeaderEdit</b> template.
    *
    * <b>RowHeaderEdit</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a row header cell in edit mode. Must be a child of the
    * {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRow} component. For example, this template shows dots in the header
    * of rows being edited:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="RowHeaderEdit">
    *     ...
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row>
    * ```
    *
    * Use the following <b>RowHeaderEdit</b> template to add the standard edit-mode indicator to cells where the <b>RowHeader</b> template
    * applies:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="RowHeaderEdit">
    *     &#x270e;&#xfe0e;
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>TopLeft</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for the top left cell. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRow} component.
    * For example, this template shows a down/right glyph in the top-left cell of the grid:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row :itemsSource="data">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="TopLeft">
    *     <span class="wj-glyph-down-right"></span>
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>GroupHeader</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a group header cell in a {@link GroupRow}. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRowCell} component.
    *
    * The <b>row</b> scoped slot property contains an instance of the <b>GroupRow</b> class. If the grouping comes
    * from {@link CollectionView}, the <b>item</b> scoped slot property references the {@link CollectionViewGroup} object.
    *
    * For example, this template uses a checkbox element as an expand/collapse toggle:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="Country" binding="country">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="GroupHeader" v-slot="cell">
    *     <input type="checkbox" v-model="cell.row.isCollapsed"/>
    *     {{cell.item.name}} ({{cell.item.items.length}} items)
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>Group</b>
    *
    * Defines a template for a regular cell (not a group header) in a {@link GroupRow}. Must be a child of the
    * {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRowCell} component. This cell type has an additional <b>value</b> scoped
    * slot property available for
    * binding. In cases where columns have the <b>aggregate</b> property specified, it contains the unformatted
    * aggregate value.
    *
    * For example, this template shows aggregate's value and kind for group row cells in the "Sales"
    * column:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="Sales" binding="sales" aggregate="Avg">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="Group" v-slot="cell">
    *     Average: {{formatNumber(cell.value, 'N0')}}
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
    *
    * <b>NewCellTemplate</b>
    *
    * Defines a cell in a new row template. Must be a child of the {@link wijmo.vue2.grid.multirow.WjMultiRowCell} component.
    * Note that the <b>cell.item</b> property is undefined for this type of a cell.
    * For example, this cell template shows a placeholder in the Date column's cell in the "new row" item:
    *
    * ```html
    * <wj-multi-row-cell header="'Date'" binding="'date'">
    *   <wj-multi-row-cell-template cellType="NewCellTemplate">
    *     Enter a date here
    *   </wj-multi-row-cell-template>
    * </wj-multi-row-cell>
    * ```
